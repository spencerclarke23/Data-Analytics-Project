In this repo are the contents of my final year Data Analytics and Computational Social Science Project, where we had to select an uncleaned and unfiltered dataset, clean it and order it and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the form of a report.
This was an individual project and contributed 40% to the final year mark for this module.
